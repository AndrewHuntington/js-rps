# Project: Rock Paper Scissors
>
> A JavaScript version of the game: Rock Paper Scissors.
>
>I decided to style it a bit like a dialog window from Final Fantasy.

## Things I Learned:
- How to include JavaScript from an external file into my HTML document.
- How to create elements using JS.
- How to add classes to nodes using JS.
- How to create and insert text content into a website using JS.
- How to select elements by name, class, and id.
- How to append elements to other elements.

## Thing I Could Improve:
- The code is probably a mess. I don't really know how to organize CSS and JS.
- Add a way to restart the game.
- Implement better support for different monitor resolutions.
- Move the buttons outside of the dialog box.
- Style the buttons more.
- Figure out how to make the border color a gradient.
